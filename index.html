<font face="Arial"> <h1>Welcome to the home of PJBeans' Projects!</h1>
<p class="tab">Welcome to <a href=pjbeans.github.io>pjbeans.github.io!</a> Here, you can find links to my GitHub Projects, along with documentation<br>
for anyone who would like to learn how to contribute to them!<br>
(Don't worry, I plan to beautify the site with Jekyll when I find the time and I feel<br>
like it)</p>
<h2>Highlighted Projects:</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/PJBeans/Lineage-OS-Installer">Lineage-OS-Installer</a>
<p>A graphical installer for the open-source Android firmware replacement <a href="http://lineageos.org">LineageOS.</a> It aims to make installing<br>
the ROM as easy and simple as possible, guiding the user through every step of what they need to do. In addition to being a graphical guide, it:</p>
<p class="tab3">- Automatically unlocks the bootloader<br>
- Automatically flashes <a href="http://twrp.me">TWRP Recovery</a><br>
- Wipes, backs up, and flashes `lineageos.zip` (LineageOS) and `gapps.zip` (Open GApps) with out the user interacting with the <a href="http://twrp.me">TWRP Recovery Interface.</a><br>
- The user does not need to type a single command to flash the ROM; it is all handled by automated scripts.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/PJBeans/verues">Verues</a>
<p>A free, open-sourced video sharing site designed as a place where users can find quality entertainment.<br>
In order for this project to be successful, I need many people to help. If you can make entertaing<br>
that people will enjoy, put them on Verues! If you already make videos and upload them to YouTube,<br>
you can simply embed those videos onto Verues!</p>
<a href="https://github.com/PJBeans/TrumpSnake">Trump Snake</a> <a href="https://github.com/PJBeans/Trump-Snake">[Not Working?]</a>
<p class="tab3">
Trump Snake is a stupid project I work on in my free time. Don't ask.
</p>
<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p class="tab2">I'm a 14 year old guy, and I work on different projects in my free time. I don't have much to say, except that I believe great things can be free.</p>
<h2>Other links</h2>
<p>My non-tech related YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCITvshid2yaFeQ8CqtXXLZQ?spfreload=10">"PJ-13"</a><br>
<p class="tab3">I also make videos when I'm bored. From stupid cooking to rather odd edits, my channel is full of useless information. Subscribe while you visit.</p></font>
