<p class="tab"><center>Welcome to <a href=pjbeans.github.io>pjbeans.github.io!</a> Here, you can find links to my GitHub Projects, along with documentation<br>
for anyone who would like to learn how to contribute to them!<br>
(Don't worry, I plan to beautify the site with Jekyll when I find the time and I feel<br>
like it)</p></center>
<h2>Projects:</h2>
<button type="button" onclick=linOS()>Lineage-OS-Installer</button>
<p>A graphical installer for the open-source Android firmware replacement <a href="http://lineageos.org">LineageOS.</a> It aims to make installing<br>
the ROM as easy and simple as possible, guiding the user through every step of what they need to do. In addition to being a graphical guide, it:</p>
<p class="tab3">- Automatically unlocks the bootloader<br>
- Automatically flashes <a href="http://twrp.me">TWRP Recovery</a><br>
- Wipes, backs up, and flashes `lineageos.zip` (LineageOS) and `gapps.zip` (Open GApps) with out the user interacting with the <a href="http://twrp.me">TWRP Recovery Interface.</a><br>
- The user does not need to type a single command to flash the ROM; it is all handled by automated scripts.</p>
<button type="button" onclick=thisIs()>This-Is-It</button>
<p>A dumb project I began working on when I got bored at school. It is really just a bunch of buttons and links that I, and anyone, can use to experiment with to learn more HTML.<br>
You can view the HTML document <a href="http://pjbeans.github.io/This-Is-It/">here</a>"</p>
<button type="button" onclick=site()>pjbeans.github.io</button>
<p>The source code for this site.</p>
<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p class="tab2">I'm a 14 year old guy who makes projects in his free time. Some of my projects are actually imporant, and some not, I just go with the flow of my mind.<br>
I encourage anyone to contribute to any of my projects, regardless if their intent is to be important or stupid. If you are looking for a starting point to<br>
begin learning anything with programming, this may be a great place to start. I am also beginning to learn different languages in programming, and I would<br>
love to help anyone who is just starting, and would also love the efforts of more experienced people to contribute to my projects (presumably the more<br>
important ones).<br></p>
<h2>Other links</h2>
<p>My non-tech related YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCITvshid2yaFeQ8CqtXXLZQ?spfreload=10">"PJ-13"</a><br>
<p class="tab3">I also make videos when I'm bored. From stupid cooking to rather odd edits, my channel is full of useless information. Subscribe while you visit.</p></font>
